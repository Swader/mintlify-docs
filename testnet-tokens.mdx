The faucet is access-code-gated, meaning you need a redemption code to get your
hands on some testnet ETH. To request a code, join us in Telegram at
[t.me/katanadevs](https://t.me/katanadevs) and explain your use case.

Another alternative is to use [the bridge](https://bridge.katana.network/) and
just bridge eth from Sepolia.

Alternatively, for local development with an infinite money glitch, try the
[Quickstart](/quickstart). That'll get you set up with a local fork of any
Katana chain, live or testnet, and unlock 10 accounts with 10000 ETH each - more
than enough to go wild testing your code on actual chain state.

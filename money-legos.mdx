AUSD is the ecosystem-native stable asset designed to be the settlement and
liquidity base on Katana.

Integrate when…
- You need stable collateral or a borrowable base asset

### Vault Bridge - Productive Bridged Assets
Bridged assets are productive by design. Users hold representations on Katana while origin-chain assets sit in yield-bearing vaults.

- Katana-side bridged tokens: bvbETH (WETH interface), bvbUSDC, bvbUSDS, bvbUSDT, bvbWBTC
- Native converters: WETH Native Converter, USDC/USDS/USDT/WBTC Converters

Integrate when…
- You want balances to earn while bridged, visible in wallets/dashboards
- You’re building LP strategies financed by origin-side vault yield
- You need safer “parking” assets across intent/cross-chain workflows
- You want access to the Katana flywheel, and benefit from the Chain Owned Liquidity

## Get started in three steps

This quickstart will help you set up and use the Katana Development Starter Kit for building applications on Katana and its testnets, Tatara and Bokuto. You'll learn how to:

- Set up your **development environment** with the Katana toolchain
- Run a **local fork** of Katana mainnet for testing without spending real tokens
- Explore Katana's **"money legos"** - composable financial building blocks

<Warning>
**Note**: Tatara will eventually be deprecated. It is recommended to use Bokuto as the testnet, or to use a local fork of Katana's mainnet, as will be described in the content below.
</Warning>

## Before you begin

Before you start building on Katana, make sure you have the required tools and access:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="check" title="Prerequisites checklist">
  - **Bun**: [Install](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) for a fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
  - **Foundry**: [Install](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) toolkit for Ethereum application development
  - **Git**: Version control system
  - **MetaMask or compatible wallet**: For connecting to networks
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 1: Clone the kit
<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Katana Starter Kit">
  Get the official Katana development repository:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/katana-network/specialk
  cd specialk
  ```

  <Info>
  The "specialk" repository contains the complete Katana Development Starter Kit with interfaces, examples, and tooling.
  </Info>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Configure your environment

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up environment variables">
  Create your environment configuration:

  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

  Edit `.env` to add your RPC endpoints, if desired (optional for local development).

  <Info>
  For local fork development, you don't need to configure any RPC endpoints as you'll be using a local Anvil fork.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies">
  Install all project dependencies:

  ```sh
  bun install
  ```

  <Check>
  Dependencies installed successfully when you see no error messages
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Run local development setup

To develop locally without spending real tokens, you can run a local fork of the testnets or the mainnet. This will make a local copy of the chain in a few seconds, running the real state but also providing you with infinite ETH on any of the open test-addresses provided by Foundry's Anvil.

This is the **recommended approach** to develop on Katana - it keeps state local and prevents RPC rate limits, while letting you play with the real state of Katana's live mainnet.

<Steps>
<Step title="Start Anvil fork (Terminal 1)">
  Run a local fork of Katana mainnet:

  ```sh
  bun run start:anvil katana
  ```

  <Info>
  This command starts a local fork of Katana mainnet using Anvil. Keep this terminal running during development.
  </Info>

  ![Anvil fork running](/images/anvil_start.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the fork (Terminal 2)">
  In a new terminal, verify your local fork is working:

  ```sh
  bun run verify:anvil
  ```

  <Check>
  If verification passes, your local Katana fork is ready for development
  </Check>

  ![Anvil fork verified](/images/anvil_verify.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Connect your wallet">
  Add the local network to MetaMask or your preferred wallet:

  ```json Network Configuration
  {
    "networkName": "Katana Local Fork",
    "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:8545",
    "chainId": 747474,
    "currencySymbol": "ETH"
  }
  ```

  <Tip>
  You can now interact with Katana contracts locally without spending real tokens. You'll have access to infinite ETH on Foundry's test addresses.
  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Explore the starter kit

<Steps>
<Step title="Build the example app">
  Compile the starter kit application:

  ```sh
  bun run build:all
  ```

  This command will:
  - Compile your TypeScript code into `dist`
  - Copy static assets like HTML, CSS, and images
  - Build the ABIs, the MCP server, and more utilities to bootstrap your environment

  <Info>
  For subsequent builds, you can use `bun run build` to rebuild only the app
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Serve the application">
  Make sure your local fork is running (Terminal 1) and serve the compiled web app:

  ```sh
  bun run dev
  ```

  <Check>
  Open your browser to the provided localhost URL to see the Katana starter app running
  </Check>

  ![Demo app running in terminal](/images/run_dev.png)
  ![Local dapp running](/images/app.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Explore the money legos">
  Browse the comprehensive interfaces for Katana's financial building blocks:

  <Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local Files">
    Browse the `contracts` directory in your cloned repository to see all available contracts and their descriptions.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Contract Directory UI">
    Visit the [Katana Contract Directory UI](https://contracts.katana.tools) for a more readable interface browser.
  </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Anvil fork won't start">
  **Common solutions:**
  - Check that port 8545 isn't already in use by another application
  - Ensure Foundry is properly installed and `anvil` is in your PATH
  - Verify your RPC URL in `.env` is correct
  - If the script isn't executable, run `chmod +x scripts/start_anvil.sh`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dependencies won't install">
  **Check these items:**
  - Ensure Bun is properly installed: `bun --version`
  - Try clearing Bun cache: `bun install --force`
  - Check internet connection and repository access
  - Verify you're in the correct `specialk` directory
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't connect to testnet">
  **Verification steps:**
  - Check the RPC URL format in your `.env` file
  - Verify network configuration matches Chain ID
  - Try the local fork first to test your setup
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build process fails">
  **Debug checklist:**
  - Run `bun run build:all` for first-time builds
  - Check for TypeScript compilation errors
  - Ensure all dependencies installed successfully
  - Verify static assets are in the correct directories
</Accordion>

<Info>
These examples ship with the SpecialK starter kit. The fork command below is a small utility that swaps the demo app with the selected example so it’s ready to build, run, and hack on immediately.
</Info>

## Pick an example

<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Wrapping" icon="rocket" href="#wrapping">
  A simple example of wrapping and unwrapping Eth into Katana-based WETH.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Wrapping

Use this example to learn the minimal flow for converting native ETH into Katana-based WETH and back.

<Steps>
<Step title="Fork and build the example" id="fork-and-build-wrapping">
  Click the button to copy the command, then paste it into your terminal in the SpecialK project root.

  <div style={{ marginTop: 12, marginBottom: 12 }}>
    <button id="fork-and-build-wrapping"
      onClick={(e) => {
        navigator.clipboard.writeText("PHONEHOME_META='{\"example\":\"wrapping\"}' bun run fork wrapping --yes");
        const el = e.currentTarget;
        const original = el.innerText;
        el.innerText = 'Copied!';
        setTimeout(() => (el.innerText = original), 1500);
      }}
      aria-label="Copy fork-and-build command for Wrapping example"
      className="px-4 py-2 rounded-md bg-black text-white dark:bg-white dark:text-black font-medium"
    >
      Fork and build
    </button>
  </div>

  Or run it manually:

  ```bash
  PHONEHOME_META='{"example":"wrapping"}' bun run fork wrapping --yes
  ```

  <Check>
  After running, your workspace contains the Wrapping example in place of the demo app and is ready to develop.
  </Check>

  <Warning>
  The fork utility replaces the demo app files in your working directory. Commit or stash any local changes before running.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="What the fork utility does">
  - **Swap demo for example**: Replaces the default demo with the selected example’s source.
  - **Prepare to build**: Ensures the example is laid out to build and run with minimal setup.
  - **Keep you moving**: Meant for quick iteration—fork, run, and start hacking.
  
  <Tip>
  You can re-run the fork command to switch to a different example at any time.
  </Tip>

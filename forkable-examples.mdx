<Info>
These examples ship with the SpecialK starter kit. The command below is a small utility that swaps the demo app with the selected example so it’s ready to build, run, and hack on immediately.

## Examples

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Demo App">
Simple demo app showing basic dependency-free wallet connection and some basic read and write operations when connecting to a locally running copy of the Katana chain.

This is the default example when cloning the starter kit and instructions are identical to the [Quickstart](/quickstart), but much shorter here.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install and set up (one-liner)">
  Paste and execute the following one-liner into your terminal. It will take care of prerequisites for you.

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://superdocs.katana.tools/static/demo.txt | bash
  ```

  <Info>
  This example runs the default demo app in the starter kit — no forking or file replacement. It is functionally identical to following the [Quickstart](/quickstart).

</Step>

<Step title="Run local Katana fork (Terminal 1)">
  Start a local fork of Katana mainnet:

  ```bash
  bun run start:anvil katana
  ```

  <Check>
  Leave this terminal running while you develop.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Serve the app (Terminal 2)">
  In a new terminal, serve the app:

  ```bash
  bun run dev
  ```

  <Check>
  Open the provided localhost URL to use the app.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Wrapping">
Use this example to learn the minimal flow for converting native ETH into Katana-based WETH and back. It is the demo app, but with wrapping functionality added in to show you how to use the included primitives, ABIs, and contract addresses.

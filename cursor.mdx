description: "Using Cursor's toolstack with Katana"

Cursor is modern VSCode fork with built in LLM support. It's a great way to get
started with Katana. Cursor also provides a CLI tool that can be used directly
in the terminal.

## MCP

The easiest way to get started with Cursor + Katana is to just load the cloned
SpecialK repo into Cursor as a project. Then, add the MCP server:

```json
{
  "Specialk": {
    "command": "bun run",
    "args": [
      "{ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT}/dist-mcp/index.js"
    ],
    "env": {},
    "working_directory": null
  }
}
```

Once this is added to Cursor, you will have access to the toolkit in the chat
UI. Here it is running an anvil chain after if first figures out another
instance is running, killing it, and then booting up its own.

## CLI

To further explore the Cursor + Katana experience, install the Cursor CLI tool
and run it like you would any other CLI tool like Claude Code. Ask it to write
and deploy smart contracts for you, run on-chain analytics over night on anvil
instances it spawns and kills repeatedly, and more.

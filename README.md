# Katana Superdocs

To contribute a guide, write an MDX file and add it to the appropriate location
in `docs.json`.

Submit a PR explaining what you added.

If you are submitting a [forkable example](/forkable-examples.mdx), make sure
the code is merged into [specialk](https://specialk.katana.tools) first.

For any questions, we're available in [KatanaDevs](https://t.me/katanadevs).

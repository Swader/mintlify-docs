# Hacker Springboard ðŸš€

Welcome hackers! This is your launchpad for building innovative DeFi
applications on Katana. Whether you're new to the ecosystem or ready to dive
deep, we've got everything you need to start hacking.

## Introduction to Katana

Katana is a chain designed specifically for DeFi that rethinks how decentralized
finance should work. Unlike other chains where liquidity is fragmented across
hundreds of protocols, Katana concentrates all liquidity into carefully selected
core applications: **Morpho** for lending, **Sushi** for spot trading,
**Vertex** for perpetuals, **Universal** for RWA, etc etc. This creates
unprecedented depth and composability for developers building the next
generation of financial applications.

What makes Katana unique is its sustainable approach to yield generation.
Through innovative mechanisms like Vault Bridge (which deploys bridged assets
into productive yield strategies), Chain-Owned Liquidity (funded by 100% of
sequencer fees, CoL yield, and other mechanisms), and revenue sharing like that
with Agora USD - the Treasury backed stablecoin - Katana creates multiple yield
streams that benefit all participants. This means higher, more sustainable
yields for users and deeper liquidity pools for developers to build on top of.

## Katana-Adjacent Technology

Understanding the broader technology stack will help you build more powerful and
interoperable applications.

### AggLayer: Cross-Chain Interoperability

</Tabs>

The AggLayer is a trustless, cross-chain interoperability protocol that connects
Katana to a growing network of chains, creating a unified liquidity layer across
the entire ecosystem. For hackathon builders, this means your Katana
applications can seamlessly interact with assets and users from multiple
blockchains without complex bridge integrations or trust assumptions.

AggLayer enables powerful use cases like cross-chain yield farming, unified
asset management, and chain-abstracted user experiences. When you build on
Katana, you're not just accessing Katana's deep liquidity - you're tapping into
the shared liquidity of the entire AggLayer ecosystem. This opens up
possibilities for innovative applications that were previously impossible with
traditional bridge-based approaches.

### Polygon: Battle-Tested Infrastructure

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBQAf6gmcW8?si=W3oKYp0QfdDjQhMy" title="Polygon Overview" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Polygon stands as one of blockchain's most proven and adopted networks,
delivering 99.99% uptime over 5 years with over 5 billion transactions
processed. With Q2 2024 alone seeing 300 million transactions at an average fee
of &lt;0.001 POL and 1.2M daily active addresses, Polygon demonstrates the scale
and reliability that enterprise applications demand.

The network's explosive growth in real-world usage is undeniable: 2.8B USD in
stablecoin supply (up 40% in Q2), 385B USD in stablecoin volume, and 236 million
stablecoin transfers completed in just one quarter. Small-to-medium peer-to-peer
USDC payments grew 75% from Q1, while large payments over 10k USD surged 30%,
totaling 15.8B USD in Q2 alone. World-class institutions including Apollo, China
AMC, Spiko, Mercado Bitcoin, and Securitize have integrated Polygon, making it
the ecosystem leader in on/off ramp integration and cross-chain support with net
flows second only to Ethereum. While not yet connected to AggLayer, Polygon's
assets can be bridged to Katana through multiple bridges, particularly via
[portal.polygon.technology](https://portal.polygon.technology).

Deploying assets from Polygon to Katana is the right way to go about doing
things - maximize yield while leveraging the undefeatable reach of Polygon.

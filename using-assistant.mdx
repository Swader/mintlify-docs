The AI assistant has as much context as there exists in the
[SpecialK Starter Kit](/quickstart). As such, it can answer anything about
Katana's broader context you could find out by loading the kit into an
LLM-enabled IDE, indexing the codebase, and asking there.

You can ask the Assistant for general information about
[Katana's primitives](/katana-primitives)...

... or for advice on what to build with them, and more.

As we expand this documentation with both official content and user-submitted
examples, the AI's knowledgebase will grow and it will become better and better
at guiding you through the Katana ecosystem's potential.

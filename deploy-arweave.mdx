The [starter kit](/quickstart) comes with support for hosting sites on the
[Arweave Name System (ArNS)](https://ar.io/arns).

## What is the Arweave Name System?

ArNS domains are smart domains provided by AR.IO Network which allow you to
associate any Arweave transaction ID with a human readable domain that is
accessible as a subdomain of any gateway in the AR.IO Network.

For example, the ArNS domains app itself is deployed to ArNS:

- [arns.ar.io](https://arns.ar.io)
- [arns.arweave.net](https://arns.arweave.net)
- [arns.permagate.io](https://arns.permagate.io)

The same app is available on multiple gateways.

You can access the same permanent site deployment as a subdomain on any of the
(currently) over 600 active gateways in the network. You can see the full list
of active gateways in the [network dashboard](https://gateways.ar.io).

This means you pay once to store your app and in return get free permanent
hosting with unlimited availability and high censorship resistance given the
globally distributed and independent nature of the gateway network.

The only constraint is that your site must be client side (similar to IPFS).
Even if you have some back end components, following the principles of
[Progressive Centralization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkL5xuNVAS4), you
should always strive to make your front end as decentralized as possible.

## Getting started

ArNS support is provided via a CLI tool called
[permaweb-deploy](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-deploy) and a GitHub
Workflow that will deploy your site to ArNS on each push to your main branch.

This setup handles uploading your build folder to Arweave using
[Turbo](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/turbo/what-is-turbo.html), creating a
[manifest](https://docs.ar.io/concepts/manifests), and then updating your ArNS
name to point to your new manifest.

It has built-in support for EVM wallet signatures so the wallet you're using for
Katana should work fine.

Before the workflow will work you must fund your wallet to pay for uploads and
purchase an ArNS name.

### Funding your wallet

Turbo has a [friendly top-up page](https://turbo-topup.com/). Head to this page,
connect your wallet and top-up with either credit card or ETH (on mainnet).

This will associate a credit balance with your wallet that can be used to fund
the upload of your site data to Arweave and purchasing an ArNS name.

### Purchase an Arweave Name System (ArNS) name

Head to the [ArNS app](https://arns.app/#/?search=) to purchase a name.

The ArNS supports purchasing with fiat (credit card via Stripe), turbo credits
or [ARIO tokens](https://ar.io/token). ArNS names can be leased or bought permanently.

> **NOTE** - You can use the same credit balance to pay for uploads and ArNS
> names. The wallet you use to pay for uploads must also be the owner of the
> ArNS name.

### Update the `deploy:arweave` command

The starter kit contains the deploy command in `package.json`:

```json
"deploy:arweave": "bun run build:all && permaweb-deploy --arns-name $ARNS_NAME --sig-key ethereum"
```

Add this as an
[environment variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-variables)
in the project settings of your GitHub repo, so that this value gets
interpolated during build time.

## Automated deployment via GitHub Actions

For permaweb deploy to work you must provide the private keys for your wallet.

1. Export your private keys
2. Store as GitHub Secret with value `DEPLOY_KEY`

Follow this guide on how to
[export your private keys from MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/configure/accounts/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/#:~:text=Click%20the%20three%20vertical%20dots,private%20key%20to%20your%20clipboard).

### Push changes to your `main` branch

If you followed the steps above correctly, every time you push to your `main`
branch, the GitHub workflow will automatically:

1. Upload only the changed files to Arweave and return a TxID
2. Update your ArNS name to point to this TxID

You will now be able to view your website at `yourarnsname.ar.io` (or any other
gateway in the network).

## Using AR.IO Network testnet with ArNS

If you'd prefer to test your deployment to ArNS, AR.IO Network provides testnet
support for doing so.

1. Request tokens for your wallet from the [ARIO faucet](https://faucet.ar.io/).
2. Follow the "Using arns.app with Testnet" instructions in [this guide](https://docs.ar.io/guides/testnet#using-arnsapp-with-testnet).
3. Add `--ario-process testnet` to the end of the `deploy:arweave` command in
   your `package.json`

## Manual deployment

If you want to manually trigger a deploy, you can invoke the deploy command with

```bash
bun run deploy:arweave
```

Make sure you provide your private key as an environment variable - if it's not
already exposed, you can expose it before running the command like so:

```bash
DEPLOY_KEY=0xsomehash ARNS_NAME=myname bun run deploy:arweave
```

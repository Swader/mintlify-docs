# Katana Superdocs

> **Katana** is a purpose‑built sector-specific chain for DeFi - a Layer‑2 that speaks standard EVM but ships with native yield primitives (WETH, AUSD), deep liquidity concentrated in a few focused app and protocols, an incentive engine (KAT), and seamless cross‑rollup connectivity via [AggLayer](https://agglayer.dev).  
> These docs are designed for **doers**: the hackers, quants, tinkerers,and protocol engineers who want to ship, not read.

## Why “Superdocs”?

* **Chat‑first** – every page can be interrogated through the on‑page AI assistant, or loaded into your LLM tools.  
* **Live code** – forkable demos, local scripts, playgrounds, contract references, and more.
* **Personalization** – sign‑in with any EVM wallet to bookmark, vote, and open inline discussions.
